Ask by putting the milk with the cream in a saucepan with a split vanilla pod and its grains removed beforehand and then brought everything to a boil. Meanwhile beat the yolks with the sugar and whiten the mixture. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk and reserve it. Slow the hot milk very slowly on the egg/sugar mixture, whisking in the mixer without stopping. Return the mixture in a bowl with the vanilla pod and heat in a double boiler over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula. The preparation should not boil so as not to coagulate the proteins of the eggs. When mixing the tablespoon the spoon, remove from the heat. Pour the mixture into an ice tray and let cool by mixing from time to time and then put in the freezer. And here is the trick I found in a girlfriend if you do not have a sorbetic: used a diver mixer! It is therefore enough to mix every half hour to ventilate the ice by repeating the operation at least four times _no more than six_. After 2 hours, the ice begins to take well and it only remains to leave it in the freezer until the assembly. 2nd step :Then, prepare the shortbreads in the shirt. Ask by mixing the different flours with the cocoa powder and the sugar. Add the egg and knead until it is completely integrated into the mixture. Put the butter to melt in a double boiler and pour it over the dough. Mixing again and forming a very homogeneous ball. Spread the dough by hand or with a greased roll on a sheet of parchment paper. Cut out of shapes a little smaller than the molds that you will use for the shell of the icy bar and then place them on paper using a spatula _because they are a little brittle_. Cook for 15 min in a hot oven at 180 ° C, the shortbread must be still a little soft in the center. Let cool and keep in a hermetic metal box those that will not be used for assembly. Step 3:Then melt in a bain-marie 200 g of gluten-free chocolate. Remove it once melted so that they cool up to room temperature and then put it back in a double boiler so that it finds a liquid texture. In small cake molds or intended for the making of bars, spread the chocolate on a layer of two to three millimeters on the side and a little more on the bottom, making sure that we cannot see the mold and Leave to take. Repeat the operation a second time to obtain a fairly thick shell. Reserve the rest of the melted chocolate at room temperature for the shell closing. Step 4:Then switch to the realization of the caramel with salted butter: heat a pan over high heat and pour the sugar into it, mixing with a whisk until all the sugar has completely melted _be careful not to burn it! Continue mixing out fire if necessary_. Then lower the heat and add the butter by continuing to mix and then add the milk slowly and let the caramel reduce about 5 min, still beating. Pour the caramel into a container and let cool at room temperature. Now you have all the items to go to editing! Step 5:Bring out the freezer_s ice and fill the shells with two thirds with it. Then place a good fillet of salted butter caramel on the ice then add a shortbread in the shirt. Put the molds in the freezer 30 to 45 min. Meanwhile, re -shaped the reserved chocolate beforehand. Recover the bars in the freezer and close the shells. Be careful, as the bars are frozen, the chocolate should not be too hot so as not to melt the ice, but not too lukewarm either so as not to take immediately. I advise you to let it cool for 10 min at most. Put the bars completed in the freezer. After two hours, unmold and keep in the freezer in an airtight box. To serve the days of great heat, to impress your friends or for the end -of -year holidays approaching!	22
