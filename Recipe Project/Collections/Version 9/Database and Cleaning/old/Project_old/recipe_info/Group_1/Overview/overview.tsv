For a cool entrance and full of pep you have to choose quality kiwis, with the flavor that is both sweet and acidic, with the tonic color. For this the Kiwi of the quality Landes is ideal, as its IGP and its red label wage it. Then you have to choose a fresh, rather female, for its fine flesh and coral. To offer a tasty and stunning plate I chose to make a kiwi jelly, which is the basis of the recipe. The fruit simply went to Chinese then associated with a hint of agar-agar and heated for 2 minutes. 2nd step :After a socket in the refrigerator we cut the square jelly on which the crumbled crab is placed with a thick cream, a few feather features and then seasoned. Step 3:Action: peel the meal flesh and incorporate the thick crème fraîche. Add a few coasts of coral. Season with lemon juice, salt and mill pepper and set aside. Step 4:Peel the kiwis and dice them. Pass them to Chinese, helping with the back of a spoon. Collect the pulp and juice in a saucepan and add 2 grams of agar-agar. Heat, stirring for just two minutes, which allows the grip and does not alter the color of the kiwi. Pour into a square flat plate and let cool, then go to the refrigerator to freeze. To save time you can place the plate in the freezer for 10 minutes. Step 5:At the tip of a knife cut four squares of kiwi jelly. Lift them with a spatula and place them in the middle of each plate. Place the cake salad on it and set as a table with the beet leaves then the trout eggs. Season with a drizzle of organic rapeseed oil and a net of balsamic vinegar. Serve fresh. Step 6:This festive plate mixes two flavors that respond and complement each other: the tangy of the kiwi and the roundness of the cake. The textures are in contrast: the crab remains firm and the cream is soft, while the seeds of the kiwi punctuate and give rhythm to the whole. The trout eggs, iodized and radiant under the palate, highlight the set. And of course the view is flattered as soon as the dish arrives: the colors are complementary while the beet leaves curves recall the scrolls of the Guimard patterns ... Good tasting !	10

Mix to obtaining a fairly dense but a little frothy cream. Add the two eggs, the interior of the fatty vanilla pod, three pinches of salt. 2nd step :Mix, when the dough is very homogeneous, put the container immediately in the refrigerator, because it is not necessary that the butter melts. Concrete the chocolate to make small pieces. Be careful, do not do that with a knife robot, the chocolate melts quickly and it will transform into a kind of more or less melted powder so, crush with a knife! Step 3:Take out the preparation from the refrigerator and gradually incorporate the flour and half of the yeast sachet or a teaspoon of baking soda. The ideal is to sift together the flour and yeast or bicarbonate, before incorporating them, this allows you to distribute well in the whole dough yeast or bicarbonate. Step 4:Mix well, you must obtain a more compact dough. Add the chocolate to the dough and mix a little, so as to distribute it in a homogeneous manner. Put the container in the refrigerator again, at least an hour and a half. The reason ? To prevent the butter from melting and making the dough too liquid, and to leave the yeast _or the bicarbonate_ to act. Once the hour spent, it is time to go to cooking. Print the oven to 200 ° C. Arrange a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. It is not useful to butter it, the butter in the preparation will prevent cookies from sticking with paper. Step 5:Arrange the dough balls three centimeters in diameter approximately. Using an ice cream to shape the dough balls is very practical for calibrating cookies. You have to space the dough balls, because they will spread out while cooking. With the amount of dough it is possible to prepare two grids. Cook them together in a batch.

Then, I incorporate my sourdough and the rest of the elements except the salt and I start to knead my dough quietly at speed 1 for 5 minutes. Then, I add my salt and petri another 5 minutes at speed 2. This is when I can realize if my dough is wet or not, it depends on the humidity content of my flour reason why It is difficult to give an exact amount of water for my recipes. The dough should not be too dry or too wet. It is by regularly making bread that we learn to dose well. I finished the preparation of my dough by kneading it for another 5 minutes by hand on my work surface then, I put it in a oiled bowl so that It does not stick to the walls during the first lifting.

This is the best way to know if it_s good or not. Once out of the oven, I put it on a rack to let it cool _do not let the bread on flat surface cool in order to prevent the bread to be soft below_.	11

You need prepared egg whites, that is to say already separated from their yolks, and waiting in the refrigerator for a few days, but not cold, they will be optimized for the success of your macaroons.

Sift it so much for so much. 2nd step :Cook the sugar and water at 121 ° C _if you want to color your macaroons, it_s time to incorporate a point of food coloring powder in the syrup; here I chose not to color my macaroons_ . To make this syrup _do not mix sugar and water, the sugar will dissolve on its own_, use a brush dipped in water and pass on the edges of the pan to avoid the crystallization of sugar on The walls, at the start of cooking and in the middle of cooking _or when you want if you are super anxious at the idea of ​​missing your macaroons_. Step 3:Go up the 125g of whites _kept at room temperature in a tightly closed box for at least 2 days_ to the drummer when the sugar is 115 ° C. They will then be of good consistency when the syrup will reach 121 ° C _they must not Be too firm, mounted but still soft; when birds appear on the top of the whites, these are ""broken"" and will not be able to incorporate the syrup: the macaroons will be missed_. Pour the sugar cooked at 121 ° C _when the sugar is cooked at this temperature, we speak of ""bubble"": the sugar ball forms and rolls easily with the fingers soaked in very cold water_ gradually on the White, by pouring it along the walls of the robot bowl. Make a good speed in maximum speed. Stop the whites when they are well mounted and they have reached the temperature of 50 ° C _this can take 5 to 10 minutes_. Here you have made an Italian meringue! Step 4:Then mix with the 125g of remaining egg whites and so much for so much with a spatula. Smooth and drop the mixture. Macaron mass should not be too consistent _dry_. Step 5:Poach for approxial balls 6 to 7 g. Using a 10 mm plain pocket and a united socket. Thierry Mulhaupt advises to poach on parchment paper and on very smooth plates of 30x40 cm of sides. 5 rows of 6 macaroons should be added to only have 30 macaroons per plate. No more to provide too much space between each shell: 2 cm is largely enough. However, try to arrange them staggered. Step 6:Tap the plaque on the worktop _covered beforehand with a cloth, otherwise it can be scary_ in order to smooth the small balls _go ahead to evacuate all your stress;_: I do not have enough strength in My small arms, the macaroons have kept a small so chic tip on the top_. Let the macaroons dry for 10 to 15 minutes: they must be dry to the touch before being baked _the atmosphere of the kitchen should not be too wet to dry the macaroons: light the hood if necessary_. Step 7:Cook for 16 minutes at 140 ° C in rotating heat. Set the baking paper if necessary on the plate using wooden clothespins. Cook a plate at a time: it_s all about humidity and treatment of this humidity with your oven. The more shells we put in the oven, the more humidity there will be in the oven. This humidity will influence the cooking of the macaroons _which will be more or less long_ and can even be fatal to the macaroons _which crack inexorably_. The sacrifice of a single sheet of macaroons makes it possible to adjust the cooking time or to determine if we should slightly open the door of the oven _to prevent the macaroons to crack_. Let cool after cooking. Step 8:To garnish my shells _diameter 5 cm, identical cooking time_, I chose a white chocolate and vanilla ganache ... and raspberries. You have to plan 6 g. Ganache by small macaroon _2.5 cm in diameter_, double for so -called individual macaroons 5 cm in diameter. In this case, I only needed 6g of ganache by macaron since I completed my garnish with beautiful and large raspberries."	6

Spread the almond powder on a baking sheet covered with baking paper or in a dish and bake for 5 min at 150 ° to dry the powder and remove the moisture. Mix the almond and icing sugar powder mixture in a robot and or pass the powders to the powder to remove the largest grains and have smoother shells.

Put a pinch of salt in the egg whites or a teaspoon of lemon juice. Match the egg whites. As soon as the whites start to make a foam and the whisk begins to make furrows in the whites, pour the first 20 gr of sugar _without ceasing to beat_. Severt Bird ""very thick and creamy, pour the second 20 gr of sugar. Then set up the speed a little. The whites will be ready when the sugar is completely dissolved. To check this, just taste the whites mounted and check that more sugar grains. Whites are ready. Make the almond/icing sugar powder mixture in the mounted whites, in 2 or 3 times. 2nd step :The macaronnage: with your horn _or flexible spatula_, go get the mixture at the bottom of the container to fold it over the top of the preparation by crushing it. Unlike a chocolate mousse type preparation or Savoy cookie in which the mixture will be delicately, there you have to get below to fold down. In the end, the preparation must have a smooth, shiny appearance and fall back into a ribbon. The main secret of the macaroon lies in this way of mixing. Step 3:The dressing of the shells. The help of a pastry bag or a pastry chef syringe, form the shells on the baking sheet. Plan the value of about a space of space between the hulls because they will slightly spread and grow on the sheet. Form size shells as regular as possible, because then it will be necessary to bring together and mount these shells together to form the macaroon. Astuce: After having formed the shells on the plate, tap the underside of the plate to make the small nipple disappear _is formed on the top of the shell. OTITY IMPORTANT: crusting. It should not immediately be bake the macaroons, but wait before cooking them. The top of the unwavered macaroons must stop so as not to be sticky to the touch. Take at least half an hour by a hot summer weather, or several hours per average temperature. Do not put them in the refrigerator but in a warm and dry place. You will know that it is time to cook them when, if you pass your finger on the macaroons, you feel that a slight crust has formed on the surface. When in doubt, it is better to have a macaroon crust a little too long than not enough. Step 4:The cooking of the shells. Macaroons are cooked at around 150 ° C and for 10 to 15 minutes. These temperatures and durations are given as an indication because they depend on your oven. It is likely that you have some trials to do to find your own data. In the 1st half of the cooking time, the macaroons will swell, and you will see the pretty collar forming _rest assured, I too am like a kid, the nose in front of the oven door, to see the magic of the macaroons To take place ..._ In the 2nd half of the time, your macaroons will continue to cooking. At that time, it is good to open the oven door 2 or 3 times, to allow the humidity to evacuate, and your macaroons not to crack. Personally, in my oven, it is 5min at 150 ° C, and 5 to 7 min at 130 ° C. Attention, it is only necessary to cook one plate of macaroons at the same time. Surve well with cooking because with the macaroons, it is a question of minutes! The cooking finished, take out without waiting for the macaroon plate from the oven and let cool for a few moments. You just have to take off the shells from the baking sheet to proceed, once complete cooling, at the final assembly of the macaroons. Step 5:The completion of the garnish. Make the Tagada strawberries and the milk in a saucepan. Heat, stirring until the candies melt. Then keep cool, so that the mixture takes. Step 6:The assembly of macaroons. Take a generous layer of your Tagada garnish on one of the hulls. Add a beautiful slice of fresh strawberry to the center of the shell. Close the macaroon with the 2nd shell, and wait a day or two before tasting, so that the flavors mix well."	7

Add a few drops of red dye and mix gently. Using a pastry bag, set up the shells on a perforated plate covered with a sheet of bitch. Let the macaroons grow 15 minutes at room temperature, then cook for 15 minutes in a hot oven. Assembly of macaroons: In a bowl, mix the strawberry jam with the poppy syrup. Place a daby jam with half of the shells using a small teaspoon, or if you are used to a pocket. Place a few hoarse strawberries on it _and cut if they are too large_, and cover with a second shell. Do the same for the other macaroons and place them on a nice dish. Degreate with a flute of rosé champagne or with coffee!	9

Two days before, macerate the split and scraped vanilla in milk and cream. Two pods for milk, 2 pods for whipping cream. Watch out the cabbage. Bring mineral water to a boil, sugar, salt and butter. Suddenly pour the sifted flour, reduce the heat under the pan. Whisk quickly to amalgamate everything until a smooth and lump -free paste is obtained. Dress the dough, it should no longer join the walls of the pan, 2 to 3 minutes over low heat. Remove from the heat, add the eggs one by one. Depending on the absorbent power of flour, the amount of eggs must be adapted. Fill a pocket with a smooth socket number 10. On a baking sheet covered with baking paper, sleeping small cabbage, as regularly as possible by spacing them, they will inflate. This time, I just brushed them with a little milk on the finger to brown them. Block the plates in the cold while preheating the oven to 250 ° C. Bake and turn off the oven for 10 minutes. Relate the oven at 180 ° C for about 20 minutes. During cooking, quickly open the oven door to let the water steam escape. Once the cabbage is cooked, rid them on a shutter. After cooling, incise the underside of each cabbage with a pointed knife and remove a small piece of dough to facilitate the passage of the socket when filling them with cream. Reserve the cooled and perforated cabbage in a dry place. The cabbage hate humidity. 2nd step :Still the day before, make the vanilla pastry cream. Bring the milk with the two vanilla pods to a boil, keep the pan from the heat source, cover and infuse 1 hour. In a terrine, mix the sugar, cornstarch and eggs. Gradually incorporate the vanilla milk, whisk and put the pan over medium heat. As soon as the cream thickens, stop the cooking and add the cold butter cut into small pieces, whisking sharply. Cool the cream quickly, film on contact and reserve in the cold. Step 3:Two hours before assembly, heat the oven at 180 ° C, bake the cabbage for 3 minutes to dry them a little more, set aside. Get out of the whipping cream with the vanilla pods and whisk the whipped cream. Incorporate this vanilla whipped cream into the pastry cream carefully. Pour into a pastry bag and fill the cabbage. On a tray, align the cabbage with decreasing rows to then facilitate assembly. Provide next a silpat or a plate covered with silicone paper. Step 4:In a saucepan pour into order, water, glucose and powdered sugar. Heat until a temperature of 165 ° C, at this temperature the caramel is blond. East the pan from the fire, let the bubbles fall, then dip the top of the cabbage one by one in the caramel, place them again by row on the silpat so that the caramel dry. Step 5:For assembly, heat the caramel again very slowly. Help yourself with a pie circle to place the first row of cabbage by sticking them to each other with a little caramel. Raise the second row by shifting the cabbage staggered and decreasing by a cabbage with each row. Use the caramel as a mortar to weld the cabbage between them until exhaustion, by regularly turning the whole to avoid an ephemeral version of the tower of Pisa! It is not easy, at least for me, believe me the boiling caramel burns very, very strong. For the decor, stick with a hint of caramel the dragees and the daisies randomly.	19

Put a pinch of salt in the egg whites or a teaspoon of lemon juice. Mount the egg whites. First operation, as soon as the whites start to make a foam and the whisk begins to make furrows in the whites, pour the first 20 gr of sugar _without ceasing to beat_. Second operation, when the whites start to form a very thick and creamy ""bird beak"", pour the second 20 gr of sugar. Then set up the speed a little. The whites will be ready when the sugar is completely dissolved. To check this , just taste the whites mounted and check that there are no more sugar grains. The whites are ready. Put the almond/icing sugar powder mixture in the mounted whites, in 2 or 3 times. Step 2:The macaronnage with your horn _or flexible spatula_, go get the mixture at the bottom of the container to fold it over the top of the preparation by crushing it. Unlike a chocolate mousse type preparation or Savoy cookie in which the mixture will be delicately, there you have to get below to fold down. In the end, the preparation must have a smooth, shiny appearance and fall back into a ribbon. The main secret of the macaroon lies in this way of mixing. Step 3:The dressing of the shells using a pastry bag or a pastry chef syringe, form the shells on the baking sheet. Plan the value of about a space of space between the hulls because they will slightly spread and grow on the sheet. Form as regular hulls as regular as possible, because then you will have to bring together and mount these shells together to form the macaroon. Tip: After having formed the shells on the plate, tap the underside of the plate to make the small nipple disappear which has formed on the top of the shell. Another important step, crusting. The macaroons should not be put immediately, but wait before cooking them. The top of the unclear macaroons must dry out so that you can no longer stick to the touch. Provide at least half an hour by a hot summer weather, or several hours by average temperature. Do not put them in the refrigerator but in a warm and dry place. You will know that it is time to cook them when, if you pass your finger on the macaroons, you feel that a slight crust has formed on the surface. When in doubt, it is better to have a macaroon crust a little too long than not enough. Step 4:Cooking the shells The macaroons are cook at around 150 degrees and for 10 to 15 minutes. These temperatures and durations are given as an indication because they depend on your oven. It is likely that you have some trials to do to find your own data. In the 1st half of the cooking time, the macaroons will swell, and you will see the pretty collar forming _rest assured, I too am like a kid, the nose in front of the oven door, to see the magic of the macaroons take place ..._. In the 2nd half of the time, your macaroons will continue to cook. At that time, it is good to open the oven door 2 or 3 times, to allow the humidity to evacuate, and your macaroons not to crack. Personally, in my oven, it is 5 minutes at 150, and 5 to 7 minutes at 130. Attention, it is necessary to cook only one plate of macaroons at the same time. Watch for cooking well because with the macaroons, it_s a question of minutes! The cooking finished, take out without waiting for the macaroon plate from the oven and let cool for a few moments. All you have to do is take off the shells from the baking sheet to proceed, once complete cooling, at the final assembly of the macaroons. Step 5:The achievement of the ganache in a saucepan, boil the cream. Cut the fire. Add the chocolate, cut into small pieces. Mix well so that it founds and the preparation becomes homogeneous. Add the Curaçao. Then let cool in the refrigerator. Personally, I use light cream _white chocolate is already not very light ..._, and it_s fine. Step 6:The assembly of the macarons Spread a layer of this preparation on one of the macaroon shells. Assemble the 2 shells and voila!"	10
