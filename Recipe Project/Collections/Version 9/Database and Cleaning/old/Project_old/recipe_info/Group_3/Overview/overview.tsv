Damn by washing the grenade then dry it with a clean cloth. Cut the pomegranate in half in the width direction and start pressing it as if you would do it with a citrus. Place a sieve above a large bowl and filter the pressed juice and the grains of the fruit in order to obtain a perfect pomegranate juice. The adding sugar in your pomegranate juice remains optional but an ice cube will be the welcome. 2nd step :In the blender: The grenade juice method with the blender is a saving of precious time but there is just a small drawback is that the blender will heat the fruit and thus cause a loss of its nutrients and benefits. By crushing the grains, you also take the risk of obtaining a slightly thick pomegranate porridge, rather than a beautiful fruit juice. This preparation is therefore not always to be preferred. Start by washing the grenades then dry them with a clean cloth and cut them in half. Look up the white membranes and collect the grains. Place them in the blender and mix them carefully.

Peel the onion and cut it directly into slices in olive oil. Let the onion fall _until it becomes transparent_. Peel each of the garlic cloves but do not cut the garlic, let it brown with the onion. Transfer the onion to the slow cooker. 2nd step :Peel the turnip, cut it into large cubes and brown it in the oil for a few minutes until it starts to take a little color. Once colored, pour it into the slow cooker. Step 3:Cut the cabbage in 6 to 8 quarters _keep the core to keep the foliage in the neighborhood_. Gown the cabbage in olive oil and add to the slow cooker. Step 4:Proceed in the same way with carrots _do not peel if they are very young, fresh and clean_. Cut them into two pieces. _You can cut them in 4 by cutting them lengthwise if they are really very large_. Cut the potatoes into cubes of about 2 cm _do not peel them when it comes to new potatoes, simply clean them with light water_. Brown the potatoes in olive oil until they take a little color and add them to the slow cooker. Step 5:Add the parsley _without cutting it_, the contents of the tomato sauce box and the raz el hanout _2 tea or taste spoons_. Cover the vegetables with water or chicken broth. Salt, pepper to taste _do not forget to readjust the seasoning by tasting the juice during cooking_. Step 6:Cook for 6 a.m. to High.

Add in the slow cooker. Cook for 30 minutes at High to keep them a little firm. Readjust the seasoning if necessary. _Salt, pepper, spices, Harissa possibly_. Step 8:For the preparation of the couscous semolina. Put couscous in a microwave dish, put a large knob of butter. Go to the microwave for 20 seconds to melt the butter. The quantities are not important as long as the couscous does not dip in melted butter. Refer to the manufacturer_s indications for quantities per person. Stir the couscous to impregnate it with butter. Add a handful of raisins in the couscous. Heat salt water in a cup graduated in the microwave. The quantity will depend on the amount of semolina to cook. Once the water is boiling in the microwave, pour just enough boiling water on the couscous in order to cover it with about 2-3 millimeters. Let the couscous drink the water for about 2 minutes then using a fork stir the couscous to separate the grains. Step 9:Serve the couscous in a hollow plate and place the vegetables there. Pour juice to impregnate the semolina. Enjoy your meal. Step 10:It is obviously possible to cook meat at the same time as vegetables. The North African tradition wants us to cook only one type of meat _lamb, beef or chicken_ but never several meats at the same time. As for Merguez, it seems that it is a pure French invention that is not done in North Africa. But if the heart tells you, why not make a royal couscous with all the meats and even merguez. Brown the meat in oil before adding it to the slow cooker. Prick the merguez with a fork before cooking them _this allows you to get the fat out when cooking_. Do not forget to pour this fat into your broth in the slow cooker to increase taste and flavors.	19

Keep 120 g of whites in a bowl in the refrigerator. The next day _D-2 or D-1_, take out your egg whites at least half an hour before they are at room temperature _this allows them Crown well, otherwise they give off humidity_. Put all the ingredients separately. Preheat your oven to 150 ° _Th.5_. Mix the almond powder, icing sugar and cocoa for about 2 min at fast speed, to obtain a very fine powder. 2nd step :Then divide the mixture evenly over a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Enturn and heat 5 min. This helps heat the cocoa and stabilize molecules. So the shells will not overtime. Then tell the mixture _and it_s long this step believe me!_ In a bowl or on a sheet of baking paper _and turn off your oven, you will no longer need it during a Good time_. If you zap this sieving stage, the shells of your macaroons will be granular. It_s not dramatic, but it_s less pretty ... It_s up to you! Step 3:Beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt, at maximum speed, until they become frothy. Then add the powdered sugar little by little, without ceasing to whisk. Continuous to beat the whites for about 3 min. The whites must form a point when lifting the whisk. Then come the mixture of almond powder and cocoa on the egg whites. Use with a maryse, gently incorporate the almond powder mixture - cocoa by gently lifting everything. Step 4:Add the dye, then mix again, a little more energetically. The dough must seem smooth, shiny, flexible but not liquid. Well, it was liquid ... Fill the pastry bag with dough using a maryse or a tablespoon. Then regularly pocket the shells on two plates covered with parchment paper, vertically, about 3 cm in diameter, in staggered in order to allow the air to circulate during cooking. Remember to make a peer number of shells ^^. If your dough is not too liquid, finish the paint of each shell, giving a quarter of a turn to ""cut the dough"" _and if your dough is liquid, well good luck!_. Lift the plate and tap the 2, 3 times on the work surface. Speed ​​the shells of chocolate vermicelli _optional_. Shake each plate to remove the excess of vermicelli. Look for the shells at room temperature, until the dough no longer hangs on the finger _from 40 min to 1 hour_, in a hot and dry room. This will prevent the shells from cracking when cooked. A quarter of an hour before the end of the crusting, preheat your oven to 150 ° C _Th.5_. Bake the macaroons and cook each plate for 12 min, turning them halfway through cooking. Take the shells out of the oven and let them cool on a work surface _not on hot plates_. To remove the parchment sheets from my plates, I used plastic table sets that I slide between the plate and the sheet. AA avoids burning your fingers and dropping everything! While the shells cool, prepare the ganache _below_, then take off the shells from the parchment sheet, using a spatula if necessary. Put the shells in a tupperware until the next day. Step 5:Preparation of the ganache _preferably two days before tasting or at least the day before_: in a saucepan, bring the milk and the liquid cream to a boil _about 1 min_ then incorporate the chocolate cut into pieces. Fouet the mixture and wear -Are again to a boil _about 1 min_. Part the ganache in a hollow plate. Cover with hot cling film, placing it directly on the ganache _this prevents condensation and the formation of a crust_. Leave to cool. Use the ganache in the refrigerator until it is well taken _overnight it is ideal_. Step 6:Macaroons filling _J-1 or D-Day_: Get the ganache from the refrigerator. Fill the ganache pastry bag and garnish one in two shells, placing a ganache hazelnut in the center. I tested without a pastry bag, with a spoon, and frankly it is fine! Paste the shells to each other by pressing slightly to spread the ganache well and weld the shells. Your macaroons are ready! But the best is to taste them the next day only. In the meantime, leave your macaroons in the refrigerator and remember to take them out 2 hours before tasting."	13

Then put back to the double boiler and raise the temperature to 31-32 ° C, and hold this temperature to make your cups. Me, I have a very small very thick brush, I dip it in the temperate chocolate and then I brush my silicone molds, it_s clean, I don_t put it everywhere and it goes fairly quickly. Let the cups cool and look if you have put enough chocolate because they should not be brittle but stand. There is a certain thickness. Put your molds filled with chocolate in the refrigerator if your kitchen is at an ambient temperature. Step 5:Here, the 2 hours are sold so take out your meringues. Taste a front to make sure they are not sticky to the teeth. It_s not nice. Once it is all over, we will be able to edit our Mont Blanc cups. Get out of the silicone molds all your chocolate cups.
